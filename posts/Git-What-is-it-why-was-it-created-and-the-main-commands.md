Git is the most famous and used version control system used on the world. It‚Äôs an open-source project developed in 2005 for Linus Torvalds ‚Äì the Linux kernel creator.

Before Git had all this power, it was tough handling your development versions. If more the one person was working on the same project, that could be a nightmare. For example, sharing your code and asking for one review is not an easy task how is nowadays.

# What is Git?

Git is the most used open-source version control system! Git is used to control the changes history of files, mainly for software development projects. It allows more flexibility in workflow, security and performance.

## What is a version control system?

A version control system is a tool to help teams and individual developers to administrate changes on the code base through one timeline. The version control system keeps the register of all code versions, and I mean, it registers all changes on the codebase.

In a real-world example, the control version system helps a lot in the development of an application. When some new feature is applied and breaks the application, it is easy to come back to the version that the code was working and compare it to the new broken version to easy find the error.

# How was the version control system Git created? A bit of History.

**Linus Torvalds, _the Linux kernel creator_**, created Git in 2005.

Everything happened because the Linux kernel community broke the relationship with the BitKeeper, the version control system used on the kernel project. With this break, the BitKeeper start charging to use the tool services.

In this scenario, Linus Torvalds decided to develop one version control system with better performance and use his experience using BitKeeper to create Git, then pass to be the most used version control system globally.

**_Linus had as the main target for this project:_**

- performance;
- no-linear development support;
- open-source;
- attend big projects in an efficient way.

# Where can I use Git?

You can use Git on all projects that have files, no matter what type of files. It can be a code, text, images, videos, audio, wherever. The main target is to allow control of the version history of these projects, help with teamwork workflow, and offer a safe environment for your files.

# Which the advantages and disadvantages of using Git?

You could see some advantages at this point of the post, but let‚Äôs jump on it with more details:

## Performance

You can tell that Git is the best control version system when the fact is a performance. On the core philosophy of the project, we have performance and practicality. Being an open-source project brings more agility to the development to archive the necessities of developers around the world.

## Flexibility

One significant advantage of Git is that you can adapt no linear project formats and still track each brand of the project individually, no matter the size of your project.

## Security

The integrity of one project codebase is one priority on Git. All content, versions, and commits are protected by SHA1. It‚Äôs a cryptography hash algorithm that then adds more security against accidental changes or no-accidental ones üòè. Remember that all changes are visible on track.

## Disadvantage

Git also has an essential disadvantage that we have to talk about in this post.

## More complexity

Git can be more complex to understand initially because the workflow can have many possibilities on the combination and code branches.
